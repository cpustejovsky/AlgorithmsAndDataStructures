# Big O Notation

## Why Does it matter?

- Provides devs with precise grammar to talk about code performance
  - This helps clarify trade-offs between different approaches
- Knowing how to talk about performance will help identify and notify others about code ineficiencies that may be acting as pain points
- **basically, it provides an objective way to talk about what code is "better" at least from one point of view**
  - We're not going to have a common grammar for readability, brevity, etc., but Big O will allow us one for speed and memory use

## Big O Shorthands
1. Arithmetic and assignment operations are contanst
2. Accessing element of array is also constant
3. For loops, loop.length * operationsInsideLoop
   
**auxilary space complexity:** the space required by the algorithm, not including space taken up by inputs.

# Problem Solving
## How to improve problem solving skills
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns (muscle memory)

# Problem Solving Strategy
## 1. Understand the Problem
* Can I restate the question/problem?
* What are the inputs that go into the problems?
* What are the outputs?
* Can the inputs determine the outputs? Do I have enough information (may have to circle back to later)
* How should I label this problem's important pieces of data?
## 2. Explore Concrete Examples
* Start with simple examples
* Progress to more complex exmaples
* Explore examples with empty inputs
* Explore examples with invalid inputs
## 3. Break it down
## 4. Solve/Simplify
## 5. Look back and refactor
